1. **PLAN Mode Execution**: Command must be run from PLAN mode for proper setup and coordination
2. **4-Step Process**: Setup → Plan → Execute → Finalize provides clear structure and accountability
3. **3-Phase Execution**: Foundation → Features → Integration ensures proper dependency management
4. **Worklog Architecture**: Comprehensive documentation in `tmp/worklog/` for transparency and debugging
5. **Per-Phase Commits**: Atomic commits after each phase completion for better change tracking
6. **CLAUDE.md Updates**: Automatic memory updates ensure context preservation across sessions
7. **Credit Estimation**: Provides resource consumption estimates for sprint planning

## Execution Model Benefits

- **Foundation Phase**: Establishes dependencies and shared infrastructure first
- **Features Phase**: Parallel execution of independent features maximizes velocity
- **Integration Phase**: Final polish and testing only when needed
- **Automatic Coordination**: Phase-based execution eliminates manual dependency management
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Worklog system provides full audit trail and debugging capability
- **Memory Preservation**: CLAUDE.md updates ensure sprint learnings persist across sessions

The enhanced 3-phase parallel agentic approach provides dramatic velocity improvements (~27x) while maintaining production-quality standards and comprehensive documentation throughout the development process.
