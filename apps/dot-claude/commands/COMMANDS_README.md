## Usage

To use any command, simply type the command name in Claude Code:
```
/prd-meeting <feature-description>

# Switch to PLAN mode first, then:
/sprint @backlog.md
```

For Linear integration commands:
```
# Prepare and break down an epic
/epic-prep --team Chronicle --epic EPIC-123
/epic-breakdown --team Chronicle --epic EPIC-123

# Plan sprints (breaks epic into multiple sprints)
/sprint-plan --team Chronicle --epic EPIC-123

# Execute sprints sequentially
/sprint-execute --project "CHR-123.S01"
/sprint-execute --project "CHR-123.S02"

# Check progress
/sprint-status --project "CHR-123.S02" --detailed
```

For commands with file references:
```
/prd-meeting @path/to/existing-prd.md

# Note: Sprint command requires PLAN mode and may consume significant credits
# Switch to PLAN mode first, then:
/sprint @backlog.md
```

## Adding New Commands

1. Create a new folder with the command name (kebab-case)
2. Add the command markdown file inside the folder
3. Create a `docs/` subfolder with documentation
4. Update this README with the new command information

## Support

For command-specific help, check the documentation in each command's `docs/` folder. For general Claude Code help, use `/help`.
