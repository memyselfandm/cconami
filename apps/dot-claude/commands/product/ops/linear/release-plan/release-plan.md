# Linear Release Planning Command

Design and create a comprehensive release roadmap with multiple major and minor versions, distributing epics and features across releases while considering dependencies, team capacity, and strategic goals.

## Usage
- `--team <name>`: (Required) Linear team name to plan releases for
- `--horizon <months>`: Planning horizon in months (default: 6)
- `--version <starting>`: Starting version number (default: v1.0)
- `--dry-run`: Preview release plan without creating issues
- `--strategy <type>`: Release strategy: quarterly, monthly, continuous (default: quarterly)
- `--capacity <percentage>`: Team capacity to allocate (default: 80%)

## Release Planning Strategy

### Version Numbering
- **Major Releases (X.0)**: Breaking changes, major features, architecture shifts
- **Minor Releases (X.Y)**: New features, significant enhancements, non-breaking changes
- **Patch Releases (X.Y.Z)**: Bug fixes, small improvements, hotfixes

### Release Cadence Options
1. **Quarterly**: Major release every quarter, minors monthly
2. **Monthly**: Minor releases monthly, majors as needed
3. **Continuous**: Releases when features ready, version on impact

### Capacity Planning
- Account for holidays, training, meetings (80% default)
- Buffer for bug fixes and technical debt (20%)
- Consider team velocity from past cycles
- Balance feature work with maintenance

## Instructions

### Step 1: Initialize Planning Context
1. **Launch Program Manager Agent**:
   ```
   Use the program-manager subagent to analyze the backlog and current state
   
   Prompt: "Analyze the backlog for team $TEAM and prepare for release planning
   with a $HORIZON month horizon. Identify all epics without releases, orphan
   features, and unscheduled high-priority work. Group related work and suggest
   release themes."
   ```

2. **Gather Team Context**:
   - Fetch team details and capacity
   - Review recent cycle velocity
   - Identify team specializations
   - Understand current commitments

### Step 2: Analyze Backlog
1. **Fetch Unplanned Work**:
   ```
   mcp__linear__list_issues(
     team: $TEAM,
     state: ["Backlog", "Todo", "Planned"],
     no_release: true,
     includeArchived: false
   )
   ```

2. **Categorize by Type**:
   - Separate epics, features, and standalone tasks
   - Identify critical fixes and technical debt
   - Group related functionality
   - Assess effort and complexity

3. **Dependency Analysis**:
   - Map blocking relationships
   - Identify prerequisite work
   - Find cross-team dependencies
   - Determine critical paths

### Step 3: Design Release Structure

1. **Major Release Planning**:
   ```
   For each major version:
   - Theme: Primary goal/capability
   - Epics: 3-5 major epics per release
   - Timeline: 3-4 month duration
   - Milestones: Alpha, Beta, GA dates
   ```

2. **Minor Release Planning**:
   ```
   Between majors:
   - Features: 5-10 features per minor
   - Enhancements: Improvements to existing
   - Fixes: Address known issues
   - Timeline: 4-6 week sprints
   ```

3. **Release Themes**:
   - v1.0: "Foundation" - Core functionality
   - v1.1: "Polish" - UX improvements
   - v1.2: "Scale" - Performance optimization
   - v2.0: "Transform" - Next generation

### Step 4: Create Release Plan

1. **Generate Release Issues**:
   ```python
   for release in releases:
     mcp__linear__create_issue(
       team: team_id,
       title: f"Release {release.version}: {release.theme}",
       description: release_template,
       labels: ["type:release", f"release:{release.version}"],
       dueDate: release.target_date,
       priority: 1
     )
   ```

2. **Assign Epics to Releases**:
   ```python
   for epic in epics:
     mcp__linear__update_issue(
       id: epic.id,
       labels: add(f"release:{assigned_version}"),
       parentId: release_issue.id
     )
   ```

3. **Create Release Projects**:
   ```python
   mcp__linear__create_project(
     team: team_id,
     name: f"{release.version} - {release.theme}",
     description: project_template,
     targetDate: release.date,
     leadId: team_lead_id
   )
   ```

### Step 5: Validate and Optimize

1. **Capacity Validation**:
   - Calculate effort per release
   - Compare to team velocity
   - Identify overloaded releases
   - Suggest rebalancing

2. **Dependency Validation**:
   - Ensure dependencies within same/earlier releases
   - No circular dependencies
   - Critical path analysis
   - Risk assessment

3. **Balance Optimization**:
   - Distribute complexity evenly
   - Mix of features and technical work
   - Account for ramp-up time
   - Include buffer for unknowns

### Step 6: Generate Reports

1. **Roadmap Overview**:
   ```markdown
   # Release Roadmap - Team $TEAM
   
   ## Timeline
   - v1.0 (Q1): Foundation - Auth, Core API
   - v1.1 (Q2): Polish - UX, Performance  
   - v1.2 (Q2): Scale - Multi-tenant, Caching
   - v2.0 (Q3): Transform - AI Features
   
   ## Metrics
   - Total Epics: 15
   - Total Features: 67
   - Estimated Effort: 480 days
   - Team Capacity: 520 days
   - Buffer: 8%
   ```

2. **Release Details**:
   ```markdown
   ## Release v1.0 - Foundation
   Target: March 31, 2025
   
   ### Epics
   - Authentication System (25 days)
   - Core API Framework (30 days)
   - Database Schema (15 days)
   
   ### Dependencies
   - None (foundation release)
   
   ### Risks
   - Third-party auth provider delays
   - Database migration complexity
   ```

3. **Dependency Map**:
   ```
   v1.0 Foundation
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ v1.1 Polish
         ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ v1.2 Scale
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ v1.3 Integrate
             ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ v2.0 Transform
   ```

```

## Error Handling

```
‚ùå "Insufficient capacity"
   ‚Üí Team capacity: 200 days
   ‚Üí Required effort: 300 days
   ‚Üí Reduce scope or extend timeline

‚ùå "Circular dependencies detected"
   ‚Üí Epic A depends on B
   ‚Üí Epic B depends on A
   ‚Üí Restructure epic relationships

‚ùå "No epics found"
   ‚Üí No unplanned epics in backlog
   ‚Üí Create epics first or review completed

‚ùå "Invalid version format"  
   ‚Üí Version must be vX.Y or vX.Y.Z
   ‚Üí Example: v1.0, v2.1, v1.0.1
```

## Integration with Other Commands

```bash
# Full release planning workflow
/release-plan --team Chronicle --horizon 6        # Plan releases
/dependency-map --release v1.0                    # Verify dependencies
/sprint-plan --release v1.0 --max-sprints 4       # Break into sprints
/release-execute --version v1.0                   # Execute release
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**: Plan 80% capacity initially
2. **Theme Releases**: Give each release a clear focus
3. **Balance Types**: Mix features, debt, and fixes
4. **Front-load Risk**: Complex work in early releases
5. **Regular Reviews**: Re-plan quarterly
6. **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined release scope
7. **Dependency First**: Foundational work early
8. **Buffer Time**: 15-20% buffer per release
