# Linear Sprint Status Command
Query Linear to display the current status of sprints, including progress metrics, active agent work, and any blocked issues.

## Usage
- `--team <n>`: (Optional) Show all sprints for a specific team
- `--project <n>`: (Optional) Show detailed status for specific sprint project
- `--active`: (Optional) Only show currently active sprints (issues in "In Progress" state)
- `--detailed`: (Optional) Include individual issue details and agent assignments

If no arguments provided, shows all active sprints across all teams.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Determine Query Scope

1. **Parse Arguments**:
   ```python
   if --project specified:
       # Detailed view of single sprint
       scope = "single_project"
   elif --team specified:
       # All sprints for one team
       scope = "team_sprints"
   else:
       # All active sprints across workspace
       scope = "all_active"
   ```

2. **Set Detail Level**:
   - Default: Summary statistics only
   - With `--detailed`: Include issue-level information
   - With `--active`: Filter to sprints with "In Progress" issues

### Step 2: Query Linear Data

#### For Single Project Status
```python
1. Use mcp__linear__list_projects to find project
2. Use mcp__linear__list_issues with project filter
3. Get all issues regardless of state
4. Use mcp__linear__list_comments for recent activity (if --detailed)
```

#### For Team Sprints
```python
1. Use mcp__linear__get_team to get team ID
2. Use mcp__linear__list_projects with team filter
3. Filter projects matching "Sprint YYYY-MM-NNN" pattern
4. For each sprint project, get issue counts by state
```

#### For All Active Sprints
```python
1. Use mcp__linear__list_teams to get all teams
2. For each team, list projects
3. Filter for sprint projects with active issues
4. Aggregate statistics across teams
```

### Step 3: Analyze Sprint State

1. **Calculate Phase Progress**:
   ```python
   # Group issues by phase labels
   foundation_issues = filter_by_label("phase:foundation")
   feature_issues = filter_by_label("phase:features")
   integration_issues = filter_by_label("phase:integration")
   
   # Calculate completion per phase
   foundation_complete = count(state="Done") / total
   features_complete = count(state="Done") / total
   integration_complete = count(state="Done") / total
   ```

2. **Identify Active Agents**:
   ```python
   # Find issues in "In Progress" state
   active_issues = filter(state="In Progress")
   
   # Extract agent assignments from labels
   active_agents = []
   for issue in active_issues:
       agent_label = extract_label_pattern("agent:*")
       if agent_label:
           active_agents.append({
               "agent": agent_label,
               "issue": issue.key,
               "title": issue.title
           })
   ```

3. **Detect Blocked Issues**:
   ```python
   # Find blocked issues
   blocked_issues = filter(state="Blocked")
   
   # Also check for stalled "In Progress" issues
   # (Look for issues with no recent comments)
   for issue in in_progress_issues:
       last_comment = get_most_recent_comment(issue)
       if not recent_activity(last_comment):  # No update in last hour
           potentially_stalled.append(issue)
   ```

4. **Calculate Metrics**:
   ```python
   metrics = {
       "total_issues": len(all_issues),
       "completed": count(state="Done"),
       "in_progress": count(state="In Progress"),
       "blocked": count(state="Blocked"),
       "not_started": count(state in ["Backlog", "Planned", "Todo"]),
       "completion_rate": completed / total * 100,
       "parallelization_rate": features_count / total * 100
   }
   ```

### Step 5: Special Status Indicators

#### Detect Concerning Patterns
```python
warnings = []

# Check for stalled agents
if issue.state == "In Progress" and no_recent_update(issue, hours=1):
    warnings.append(f"⚠️ {issue.key} may be stalled (no updates for 1+ hour)")

# Check for too many blocked issues
if blocked_count > total_count * 0.2:  # More than 20% blocked
    warnings.append(f"🚨 High blockage rate: {blocked_count}/{total_count} issues blocked")

# Check for imbalanced phases
if features_percentage < 60:
    warnings.append(f"⚠️ Low parallelization: Only {features_percentage}% in features phase")

# Check for sprint duration
if sprint_age > 10:  # Sprints shouldn't run more than 10 days
    warnings.append(f"⏰ Long-running sprint: Started {sprint_age} days ago")
```

#### Success Indicators
```python
successes = []

if completion_rate == 100:
    successes.append("🎉 Sprint complete! Ready to archive")
    
if parallelization_rate > 80:
    successes.append(f"⚡ Excellent parallelization: {parallelization_rate}%")
    
if active_agents > 5:
    successes.append(f"🚀 High concurrency: {active_agents} agents working in parallel")
```

### Step 6: Error Handling

1. **Linear API Issues**:
   - If unable to fetch issues: Show cached data with warning
   - If rate limited: Show partial data with retry time

2. **Malformed Sprint Projects**:
   - Skip projects not matching sprint pattern
   - Note any issues without proper phase labels

3. **Missing Data**:
   - Handle issues without agent assignments gracefully
   - Show "Unknown" for missing specializations
