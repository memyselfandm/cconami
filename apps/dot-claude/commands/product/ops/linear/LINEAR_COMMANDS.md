**Migration**:
```bash
# Old workflow:
/epic-prep --team "Chronicle" --epic EPIC-123 --execute
/epic-breakdown --team "Chronicle" --epic EPIC-123

# New consolidated workflow:
/epic-breakdown --team "Chronicle" --epic EPIC-123
```

**Legacy Purpose**: Ensured epic was properly structured with features, tasks, and metadata.
**Now Available In**: All epic-prep functionality is now the first phase of epic-breakdown.

### ~~refine-epic-lite~~ ‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED 
**This command has been consolidated into refine-epic.**

**Migration**:
```bash

/refine-epic --team "Chronicle" --lite
```

**Legacy Purpose**: Quick epic refinement with minimal 1-pager template.
**Now Available In**: Use `/refine-epic --lite` for the same lightweight template.

### 4. sprint-plan
**Purpose**: Breaks down a Linear epic into multiple focused sprint projects, prioritizing parallelization and avoiding dependency clashes.

**Usage**:
```bash
/sprint-plan --team <team-name> --epic <epic-id> [--max-sprints <number>] [--dry-run]
```

**Key Changes**:
- Now creates **multiple sprint projects** from a single epic

## üöÄ Complete Workflow Example

### Step 1: Create and Refine Epic
```bash
# Option 1: Create new epic from idea
/refine-epic --team Chronicle --lite  # For quick MVP/prototype epics
# OR
/refine-epic --team Chronicle         # For comprehensive production epics

# Option 2: Enhance existing epic
/refine-epic EPIC-123                 # Add comprehensive structure
# OR  
/refine-epic EPIC-123 --lite          # Convert to lightweight format

# Option 3: Add technical context
/refine-epic EPIC-123 --analyze-codebase  # Include codebase analysis
```

### Step 2: Prepare and Break Down Epic
```bash
# Prepare structure and create features/tasks (all-in-one)
/epic-breakdown --team Chronicle --epic EPIC-123

# If epic structure is already perfect, skip preparation
/epic-breakdown --team Chronicle --epic EPIC-123 --skip-prep

# This does:
# - Structure preparation (missing features, orphan matching, metadata fixes)
# - Readiness validation
# - Parallel codebase analysis
# - Feature and task creation
# - Dependency mapping
# - Creates: 12 features across 3 phases, 43 implementation tasks
```

### Step 3: Plan Sprints
```bash
# Break epic into multiple sprint projects
/sprint-plan --team Chronicle --epic EPIC-123

# Output:
# Created 6 sprint projects:
# CHR-123.S01: Critical Fixes (8 issues)
# CHR-123.S02: Type System (9 issues)
# CHR-123.S03: Display Components (12 issues)
# CHR-123.S04: Integration (10 issues)
# CHR-123.S05: Production UI (6 issues)
# CHR-123.S06: Documentation (2 issues)
```

### Step 4: Execute Sprints Sequentially
```bash
# Execute first sprint
/sprint-execute --project "CHR-123.S01"

# After S01 completes, execute next sprint
/sprint-execute --project "CHR-123.S02"

# Continue through all sprints in order
# Each sprint execution:
# - Updates Linear issues in real-time
# - Agents post progress comments
# - Full audit trail in Linear
```

### Step 5: Monitor Progress
```bash
# Check specific sprint status
/sprint-status --project "CHR-123.S02" --detailed

# Or check all sprints for the team
/sprint-status --team Chronicle

# Shows:
# - Completion percentage per sprint
# - Active agents and current work
# - Blocked issues
# - Recent activity from Linear comments
```

## ‚ö° Parallelization Strategy

The commands optimize for maximum concurrent execution:

### Phase Distribution Goals
- **Foundation**: <10% (only critical dependencies)
- **Features**: 70-90% (maximize parallelization)
- **Integration**: <20% (final validation)

### Agent Concurrency
- Launch all agents in a phase simultaneously
- Group related issues per agent (1-3 issues)
- Assign specializations based on technical areas
- No artificial sequencing unless dependencies exist

### Dependency Management
- Explicit blocks/blocked-by relationships respected
- Parent-child hierarchies maintained
- Technical dependencies identified from descriptions
- Default assumption: everything can parallelize

## üè∑Ô∏è Linear Label Convention

The commands use standardized labels:

### Phase Labels
- `phase:foundation` - Must run first
- `phase:features` - Main parallel work
- `phase:integration` - Final integration

### Type Labels
- `type:epic` - Epic level issue
- `type:feature` - Feature with subtasks
- `type:task` - Implementation task

### Technical Area Labels
- `area:frontend` - UI/UX work
- `area:backend` - Server-side logic
- `area:database` - Data layer
- `area:infrastructure` - DevOps/config
- `area:testing` - Test implementation

### Complexity Labels
- `complexity:small` - 1-2 day effort
- `complexity:medium` - 2-3 day effort
- `complexity:large` - 3-5 day effort
- `complexity:xl` - Needs breakdown

### Status Labels
- `sprint-planned` - Added to sprint
- `agent:N` - Assigned to agent N
- `implemented` - Completed by agent

## üìä Best Practices

### Epic Structure
1. **Clear Objectives**: Define problem, solution, and success metrics
2. **User Stories**: Include "As a user..." stories with benefits
3. **Acceptance Criteria**: Measurable, testable requirements
4. **Technical Requirements**: Specify constraints and approaches
5. **Proper Sizing**: Epics should be 3-5 sprints maximum

### Feature Sizing
- **Small**: Single component, 1-3 tasks, 1-2 days
- **Medium**: Multiple components, 3-5 tasks, 2-3 days
- **Large**: Complete subsystem, 5-8 tasks, 3-5 days
- **Too Large**: Split into multiple features

### Sprint Composition
- Mix of complexities (not all hard or all easy)
- 80%+ issues with clear acceptance criteria
- Minimize dependencies between agents
- Include testing and documentation tasks
- Leave buffer for discovered work

### Agent Execution
- Provide clear, focused prompts to agents
- Include relevant documentation references
- Specify technical approach when known
- Set quality standards upfront
- Monitor progress with sprint-status

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Epic Not Ready**:
- Missing required sections in description
- No acceptance criteria defined
- Vague or incomplete objectives
- Solution: Run epic-prep to identify gaps

**Poor Parallelization**:
- Too many dependencies identified
- Features too tightly coupled
- Solution: Review and split features differently

**Agent Failures**:
- Unclear requirements in Linear issues
- Missing technical context
- Solution: Update issue descriptions with details

**Blocked Issues**:
- External dependencies not resolved
- Waiting for reviews or approvals
- Solution: Escalate or find workarounds

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check epic structure
/epic-prep --team <team> --epic <epic>

# View sprint composition
/sprint-status --project <project> --detailed

# See all team sprints
/sprint-status --team <team>
```
