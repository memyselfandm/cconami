# PRD: User Authentication System

## Executive Summary
The User Authentication System provides secure user registration, login, and session management for the web application. This feature solves the critical need for user identity verification and personalized access control. The system enables users to create accounts, securely log in with email/password credentials, maintain authenticated sessions, and access protected resources. It implements industry-standard security practices including password hashing, session tokens, and CSRF protection to ensure user data remains secure while providing a seamless authentication experience.

## Key Features
- User registration with email verification
- Secure password-based login with bcrypt hashing
- JWT-based session management with refresh tokens
- Password reset functionality via email
- Account lockout protection against brute force attacks
- Remember me functionality for extended sessions
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) support
- Social OAuth integration (Google, GitHub)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) foundation
- Comprehensive audit logging for security events

## Technical Specs
### Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user data, Redis for session storage
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with refresh token rotation
- **Password Security**: bcrypt for password hashing (12 rounds)
- **Email Service**: SendGrid for transactional emails
- **Frontend**: React with Context API for authentication state
- **Validation**: Joi for input validation and sanitization
- **Security**: Helmet.js, rate limiting, CSRF tokens

### Architecture
- **Microservice Pattern**: Authentication service as standalone microservice
- **Database Layer**: User model with encrypted PII, separate sessions table
- **API Gateway**: Centralized authentication middleware for route protection
- **Token Strategy**: Short-lived access tokens (15 min) with long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Session Storage**: Redis cluster for scalable session management
- **Email Queue**: Background job processing for email delivery
- **Frontend Integration**: HTTP-only cookies for token storage, automatic token refresh

### Technical Notes
- Implement progressive enhancement for authentication UI
- Use secure cookie flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite) in production
- Consider implementing WebAuthn for future passwordless authentication
- Audit logs should include IP addresses, user agents, and timestamps
- Rate limiting should be IP-based with exponential backoff
- Password policies should enforce minimum complexity requirements
- Consider implementing device fingerprinting for additional security
