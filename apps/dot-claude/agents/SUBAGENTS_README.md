## Usage

Subagents are automatically invoked by Claude Code when their specialized expertise is needed. They can also be explicitly called using the Task tool.

### Automatic Invocation
Claude Code will proactively use subagents when:
- Their description matches the current task
- The primary agent recognizes the need for specialized expertise
- The task complexity warrants delegation

### Manual Invocation
```bash
# Example: Using Task tool to invoke a subagent
Task.invoke({
  subagent_type: "slash-command-architect",
  description: "Review the git-status command",
  prompt: "Review and validate the existing git-status slash command for best practices"
})
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Proactively**: Don't wait to be asked - use subagents when their expertise applies
2. **Delegate Complex Tasks**: Let specialists handle domain-specific work
3. **Review Mode**: Use review capabilities to validate existing implementations
4. **Context Isolation**: Each subagent maintains its own focused context
5. **Tool Minimization**: Subagents only have access to necessary tools

## Creating New Subagents

To create a new subagent:

1. Use the `subagent-architect` to design the agent
2. Create a new directory in `apps/dot-claude/agents/`
3. Add a markdown file with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: your-agent-name
description: Clear description of when to use this agent
tools: List, Of, Required, Tools
color: optional-color
model: optional-model-preference
---

# Purpose
[Agent's specialized purpose and expertise]

## Instructions
[Detailed operational instructions]

## Best Practices
[Domain-specific best practices]

## Report Format
[Expected output format]
```

## Subagent Selection Criteria

Claude Code selects subagents based on:
- **Task Match**: Description alignment with current task
- **Proactive Keywords**: "Use proactively" in description
- **Specialization Need**: Task requires domain expertise
- **Complexity**: Task warrants delegation
