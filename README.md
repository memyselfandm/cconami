# Claude Code Enhancements

This is my personal system of Claude Code enhancements.

│   ├── agents       # claude code agents
│   ├── hooks        # claude code hooks
│   ├── commands     # claude code slash commands (see COMMANDS_README.md)
│   └── settings     # claude code settings
```

## Commands

See [COMMANDS_README.md](./apps/dot-claude/commands/COMMANDS_README.md) for available custom slash commands and their documentation.
